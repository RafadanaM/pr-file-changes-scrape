# Github PR File Changes Scrapper
A web scrapper written in JS that retrieves file changes made in a given PR

## How to use
- Clone this repository
- Go inside the repository
- Run `npm install -g .`
- Run `pcs -u url`. For example: `pcs -u https://github.com/org-name/repo-name/pull/1`
- Your changed files will be printed

***Note: I made this purely because I'm too lazy to manually copy & paste file changes for my course's project PR***
